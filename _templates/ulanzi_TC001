This is an 8x32 addressable LED display with built in battery, buzzer, light, temperature and humidity sensor.

It can be easily flashed using the USB-C port in the back.

After applying the template use command `Pixels 256` to set number of LEDs.

To use the pixel display in Tasmota see [ArtNet control](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/ArtNet/) or [Addressable LED's in Berry](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Berry_Addressable-LED/).
