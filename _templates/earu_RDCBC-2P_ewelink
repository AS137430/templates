This device, on version eWeLink (november 2023), have PSF-B01 no Tuya MCU. PSF-B01 is a single-channel ultra-low-power Wi-Fi switch module based on ESP8285. It can flash with Tasmota USB serial TTL. ([(https://templates.blakadder.com/PSF-B.html)](https://templates.blakadder.com/PSF-B.html))

Notes:

- 2P version is in fact 1P+N (the relay cuts the live only)
- The enclosure of 2P and 4P versions is secured with only two screws and can be dismantled without damage (unlike narrower 1P versions that are riveted and must be destroyed)
- No need to make a connection between the GND and GPIO pins of the PSF-B01 chip when flashing, as the button is already connected to these pins and can be pressed when powered up
