A triangle screwdriver bit is required to open the device and replace the module. The built-in WB2S module is easily desoldered with hot air and replaced with a pin-compatible TYWE2S / ESP-02S module.

It is recommended to pre-flash the ESP-02S module before soldering it to the main PCB, as reaching the `GPIO0` test pad on the rear of the new ESP-02S module to ground it during boot for serial flashing is obstructed by a capacitor.
