The device contains an ESP12F. To put the device in programming mode, I tied GPIO0 to ground. GND, TX and RX are the only connections needed to successfully flash the device with tasmota. With the provided configuration, it's necessary to run `SetOption1 1` and `SetOption13 1` to prevent the device from resetting.
