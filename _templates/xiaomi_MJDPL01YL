"I'm not aware of other methods for flashing tasmota, maybe is possible use the Xiaomi app to upload the firmware.

The bulb is RGBW and it uses a custom ESP8266 PCB
you have to set SetOption105 1 in console

The bulb has a silicone pour all around, it can be easily removed with a cutter https://ibb.co/9Zrh017
