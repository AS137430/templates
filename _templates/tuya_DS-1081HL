This light switch is sadly not the same as Tuya T1 DS-1081**WL**. This one is labeled as DS-1081**HL**. 

#### PCB

Here is the PCB Pinout and Pins to connect for flashing.
GPIO 9 is mandatory to pull to GND when booting to enter flash mode.
See also already existing template for [ESPC2-12 (GPIO8 is not needed on this PCB)](https://templates.blakadder.com/ESPC2-12.html).
And yes two pins aren't connected on the ESP Chip. The one above GPIO9 is not connected. Also the EN Pin (right bottom corner) is not connected.

#### Flashing Firmware

This ESPC2-12 (aka ESP8684) only has 2 MB of flash. 

This means you will need a Tasmota firmware which fits in the 2 MB flash.
Either compile it yourself or search on google for tasmota specials version 2m (I don't know if I'm allowed to post links to custom builds).
Then flash with esp-tool or similar tools.

```
.\esptool.exe write_flash 0x0 tasmota32c2_2M.factory.bin
```

#### Template and Config

After flashing remove wires and connect PCB back to the main PCB. In my case I couldn't boot the PCB with only USB power.

Here is the modified template to make the basic functions work. I disabled the LedLink LED because with that, one blue LED would be always on. It can be enabled again when GPIO9 is set as LedLink.
Setting **GPIO3** as **Led_i** activates the **red LED** when the **relay / switch is off** and switches to an **blue led** (red led off then) when **relay / switch is on**.
